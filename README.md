> The official landing site for Bits of Good 🚀

## Install Dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

## Start up the site

If you're working in development, run the following to build + run the site with live reloading goodness:

```sh
yarn dev
```

For production builds, run the following to build and start the site:

```sh
yarn build && yarn start
```

In either case, you should be able to visit `localhost:3000` to see the website in action!

## Run the tests

This site uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for thorough end-to-end testing. To start up the testing environment, you can run:

```sh
yarn test
```

This will start the server and open Cypress. You can (and should!) add tests in `cypress/integration/spec.js` — consult the [Cypress docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell) for more information.
